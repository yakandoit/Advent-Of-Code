# Advent Of Code With Python üêç 
___

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels created by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/).
I've worked with python in middle school but most courses at my university don't go too in depth into it. I may be late to the party, but I plan on using Python to complete the puzzels so that I can refresh my memory and learn to use it in new ways. You can see my solutions in this repo.

After completing it, I plan on going back to some solutions to make them more efficient and reducing their time complexity
